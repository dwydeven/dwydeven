## Hello weary travler ðŸ‘‹

### Full time student in during the school year, full time market maker in the summer, part time trader always
### Currently working on an event contract market making algorithm
### If you are someone interested in hiring me, I am open to sharing a large portion of my algorithm with you
#### However, most of that work, of which there is a lot, is not public for obvious reasons
### The projects in here I don't maintain or update, mostly from past classes and random things
